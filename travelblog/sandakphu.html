            As I sat in the train all ready to trek Sandakphu again, I couldn't help but question my motives. I had already been there, why go there again? Sure, that time was solo, this time I have company. But how different an experience is this going to be?
        </p>
        <p>
            Sandakphu, at a height of <b>3636 meters</b>, is the highest point in West Bengal, India. It is a very unique region as from Sandakphu you can see <b>4 of the 5 tallest peaks</b> in the world. The trek is moderately easy, and takes <b>3 days with 11 hour walks</b> or <b>4 days with 8 hour walks</b>. The trail winds through meadows, streams and rhododendron forests, and if done at the right time, offers an opportunity to see a host of flora and fauna. April is the month if beautiful Rhododendrons are your calling.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was October. I don't know if being colorblind has a role but I never found flowers very appealing. I was going for the love of the mountains, and October has the clearest skies in this region.
        </p>
        <p>
            I met 2 of my friends Nirmal and Prasid at New Jalpaiguri station early in the morning. We had breakfast and then set off in search for a jeep to take us to <b>Maneybhanjang</b>, the base camp for our trek.
        </p>
        <p>
            New Jalpaiguri and Siliguri are twin cities. Big and bustling. A short tuktuk ride from the station took us to the central bus stop. <b>Shared jeeps</b> are plenty and cheap, but it is incredibly difficult to find one that drives directly to Maneybhanjang. Instead, the journey needs to be done in <b>3 parts</b>. From <b>Siliguri to Mirik</b> (there's a beautiful lake), then on to <b>Sukhiyapokhari</b>, and finally a 20 minute ride in a van till <b>Maneybhanjang</b>.

                        The trek usually extends past Sandakphu to Phalut, but we chose a <b>shorter route</b>. We would trek the sector up to Sandakphu in <b>2 days</b> with a <b>night stop at Gairibas</b> down in the valley between Tumling and Kalapokhari and return on the 3rd day to <b>Sepi</b> or <b>Rimbick</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The <b>first day</b> would see us trek about <b>15 Kilometers</b> through <b>Chitrey</b>, <b>Meghma</b> and <b>Tumling</b> (highest point for the day), then down the valley to <b>Gairibas</b> where we <b>stop for the night</b>. Next morning, a very steep trek up to ,<b>Kalapokhari</b> and then a steeper one till <b>Sandakphu</b>. The planned return was 16kms in a day, but steep downhill to <b>Sepi</b> from where jeeps are available to Darjeeling/NJP.

            Maneybhanjang is a very small village right at the border between India and Nepal; it is roughly a row of houses on each side of a road. We reached Maney at around 2PM in the afternoon. It was covered with thick clouds, so the joke was on me. However, we quickly found a place to stay at the east end of the town. There are only 2-3 stays to choose from. Very basic. You get a bed, a blanket and a bathroom. But that's all that you need.
        </p>
        <p>
            A guide is essential on such treks as they keep you from getting lost in the wilderness. The guides' union sits in a shack by the road a 5 minute walk down. We booked a guide who promised to meet us at the hotel the next morning at sunrise. We then loitered down one of the foggy roads. Suddenly out of the mist, a small torn down blue and white buiding emerged. A board on top said Nepal Police. The border runs right through the village. I like these kind of borders, borders which only exists in maps. The sun set and it was getting dark. The fog made it really hard to see anything at all. We decided that it would be a good idea to return back to the hotel. We had a long day ahead. 
        </p>

        <!-- <img src="../assets/img/sandakphu/sandk14.jpg" class="img-fluid fullpic" /> -->
        <p>
            Just as promised, our guide was outside our hotel at the break of dawn. We brushed, took a quick shower and were ready with rucksacks on our backs. The trail starts right where the town ends. A sharp u-turn and up the hill, a milestone announced that Sandakphu is 32kms away. One step at a time we made our way up. The clouds hadn't lifted yet but were not as thick as the previous day. It was cold and the walk through the thickly forested pine jungle covered with white smokey clouds, was dreamlike. Through a small opening in the cloud cover, we could see the monestery at the top. The hike up, to the monestery is steep and then becomes level. 2kms and about 45 minutes later, we finally reached the monestery.
        </p>
        <p>
            A small shack serves coffee to the trekkers. Here shops and homes do not have a clear distinction. We went in and the friendly locals invited us right into their living room. They see tea, coffee, eggs and wai wai (instant noodle) with vegetables. It was really early and we needed coffee. So, a cup of coffee later, feeling rejuvinated, we started again.
            Everything was covered by thick fog now.
        </p>
        <p>
            I remembered how different my previous experience was. When I had come here it was very sunny and I remembered the line of prayer flags that looked fantastic against the blue sky.
        </p>

            On a clear day, the first glimses of the snow capped Himalayas in the north can be seen from here. Nevertheless, walking through the clouds was a magical experience. The pine forests had given way to beautiful green meadows, littered with thick bushes here and there. Suddenly out of nowhere a cute little dog started following us. We fed it biscuits and played with it a bit. It followed us some more and then bored, went on its own way. As we hiked along, we kept our gaze towards the north in the hope of catching a break in the clouds, but to no avail. 
        </p>
         <p>
            We soon left the marked trail as our guide led us up a small hillock, through some dense bushes and down the other side. A shortcut. We could see Lamaydhura in the distance. 3 shacks by the side of the road. That's it. We had been walking for the last 2 hours now, so we took a short break here and drank another cup of coffee, had a few biscuits and filled up our water bottles. 15 minutes. Our breaths back, we moved on.<br/>
        </p>

                    <p>
                    The path twisted and turned through the meadows. Uphill then downhill and then uphill again. Munching on the Gooddays (biscuits) in our pockets, we kept on moving. No one else in sight. Far, far away from the chaos of city life. Away from all the worries. We were so far away from civilization that even the cell phones didn't work anymore. We were truely in the lap of nature. In peace.<br/>
                    After a 2 hour walk, we finally approached Meghma. Meghma is the largest town in this part of the trek. We passed its famous monestery and for the first time in a while we saw houses that were not shacks. Proper brick and mortar houses. It was noon now and we were starving.
                </p>

        <p>
             We soon found a small restaurant serving wai wai. Wai wai up in the hills, during the treks tastes a hundred times better than any instant noodle that you would make at home. We had a quick snack and as a ritual, remembered to fill up our water bottles and started walking again. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The road here forked straight up to Tonglu, and left slightly downhill to Tumling. People who hike this route in 3 days walk till Tonglu and stay the night. But since we were on a tighter schedule, we took the shorter route through Tumling. The slightly downhill route meant that we could relax a bit. Our guide let us know that we were ahead of the schedule he had planned. So, we took our time and inched towards our next stop, Tumling.
