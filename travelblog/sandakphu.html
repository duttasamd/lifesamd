            As I sat in the train all ready to trek Sandakphu again, I couldn't help but question my motives. I had already been there, why go there again? Sure, that time was solo, this time I have company. But how different an experience is this going to be?
        </p>
        <p>
            Sandakphu, at a height of <b>3636 meters</b>, is the highest point in West Bengal, India. It is a very unique region of the world as from Sandakphu you can see <b>4 of the tallest 5 peaks</b> in the world. The trek is moderately easy, and takes <b>3 days with 11 hour walks</b> or <b>4 days with 8 hour walks</b>. The trail winds through meadows, streams and rhododendron forests, and if done at the right time, offers an opportunity to see a host of flora and fauna. April is the month if beautiful Rhododendrons are your calling.
        </p>
        <p>
            This was October. I don't know if being colorblind has a role but I never found flowers very appealing. I was going for the love of the mountains, and October has the clearest skies in this region.
        </p>
        <p>
            I met up with 2 of my friends Nirmal and Prasid at New Jalpaiguri station early in the morning. This trek was originally their plan, and they asked me join just a week before, an offer which I readily accepted. United, we had breakfast and then set off in search for a jeep to get us to <b>Maneybhanjang</b>, the base camp for our trek.
        </p>
        <p>
            New Jalpaiguri and Siliguri are twin cities. Big and bustling. A short tuktuk ride from the station took us to the central bus stop. <b>Shared jeeps</b> are plenty and pretty cheap, but it is incredibly difficult to find one that drives directly to Maneybhanjang. Instead, the journey needs to be done in <b>3 parts</b>. From <b>Siliguri to Mirik</b> (there's a beautiful lake), then on to <b>Sukhiyapokhari</b>, and finally a 20 minute ride in a van till <b>Maneybhanjang</b>.

                    The trek usually extends past Sandakphu to Phalut, but we chose a <b>shorter route</b>. We would trek the sector up to Sandakphu in <b>2 days</b> with a <b>night stop at Gairibas</b> down in the valley between Tumling and Kalapokhari and return on the 3rd day to <b>Sepi</b> or <b>Rimbick</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The <b>first day</b> would see us trek about <b>15 Kilometers</b> through <b>Chitrey</b>, <b>Meghma</b> and <b>Tumling</b> (highest point for the day), then down the valley to <b>Gairibas</b> where we <b>stop for the night</b>. Next morning, a very steep trek up to ,<b>Kalapokhari</b> and then a steeper one till <b>Sandakphu</b>. The planned return was 16kms in a day, but steep downhill to <b>Sepi</b> from where jeeps are available to Darjeeling/NJP.
