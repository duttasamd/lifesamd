            One of the biggest advantages of living in Bangalore is the number of easily reachable travel destinations that surround it. Overnight bus journeys on weekends, with my friend Meghdipa, to such exotic locations were a norm while I was living in Bangalore. I still remember complaining to eachother about a long and busy work-week on a Thursday and deciding that we absolutely needed to get on a bus and get away that weekend. A colleague of mine, Rahul had been to Gokarna the previous week and rated the place very highly, and since in general he recommends good things, we decided to visit the beaches of Gokarna that weekend.

            Tickets bought, bags packed, I couldn't wait for the Friday work shift to end. I left early, took a shower, got on a cab and off I was towards Indiranagar metro. That was the usual drill. Meet Meghdipa at the metro and take a train to Majestic. And every time without fail, I would be just late enough that I would panic half way to the station that I might not make it on time. This was one of those times, but fortunately I reached in time, we took the crowded train and were on our way.

            I think Bangalore's population halves every friday when thongs of people leave the city for greener pastures and prettier vistas only to return back on Monday morning to their desk jobs. We were one of the herd. We got down at the Majestic metro. Virtually the entire train got down at Majestic metro. Most with a packed bag in hand. Everyone was going somewhere.

            Our bus was a bit late, we got on, got seated and before I knew it, we were fast asleep. The next thing I remember is waking up in the morning, the bus meandering through some hills at a snail's pace. Thick jungles outside. We were crossing the Western Ghats. The Arabian Sea is right across. We should be very close now.
